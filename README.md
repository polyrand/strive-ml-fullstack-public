# Full Stack Module

Hello everyone! This week we are going to build a complete project. We are going to start from zero, with an empty github repository.

We will learn how to go from a model to a product. Machine learning models only make sense if people can use them and solve a problem. We will deploy some models to AWS, learn about "the cloud" and the whole machine learning lifecycle.

We will also learn how to scructure our projects in a clean way. You will also create a full documentation site for your project (you can even use the same techniques to create your personal blog!), and that documentation site will get updated automatically when you push to a git repository.

We will start the week with a new git repository. Throughout the week we will develop a complete machine learning project, keeping it organized, clean and documented. The models will have some interface for users, and we will deploy as much as we can to remote servers. However, we are engineers, and we don't want to do repetitive work, computers can do it for us. That's why we will also try to automate as many things as possible.
